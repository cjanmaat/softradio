A sample of a chrome packaged app that is like a radio on your desktop, It can play the online streams from radiostations for example. Currently there are just a few Dutch station loaded. To listen to and to set an example for other stations that do not provide their content in a HTML5-compliant format.

One of the main reason to make this an packaged app is the situation of having the online radio hidden in the browsertabs. Now it can sit nicely in the taskbar.

It also touches the problem where now online providers of third-party content, or hyperlinks, are in debate with the copyrightorganisation. An app on the desktop would be more obviously analogue to a FM-receiver, which is simply part of an infrastructure.

It was made more as a proof of concept, but maybe it will be polished and the list of channels extended.
